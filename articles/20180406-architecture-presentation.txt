<h2>Architecture presentation</h2>
<p>2018-04-06</p>

<p>
I've read the book Clean Architecture by Robert C. Martin. It contains a lot of good advice on design, and I especially enjoyed the parts about SOLID and the component principles. Before reading the book, I hadn't given these principles much thought, thinking that they were superfluous. However, they turn out to be guiding me daily in my work.

<p>
I put together a presentation for my colleagues to show the concepts that I thought were the most interesting. It can be found <a href="/static/pdf/architecture.pdf">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Coming up with concrete examples was essential for me to better understand the principles. At the time I was working on project related to sports betting regulations, so naturally the examples are from that domain. 
</p>

<p>
The presentation sparked some interesting discussions. As my colleague said, these are principles that we follow naturally, but it's good to have a name and definition so that we can better reason about our decisions.
